This is a GUI application. By pressing the screen, we create new colourful moving circles.

At first, we create a circle that has random speed by pressing the screen. If the circle goes to the border of the screen, it will ricochet back..

If we try to press to the places that the distance between my mouse's place and the border smaller than the size of circle, we can not create a circle unless we got a circle with smaller size.

At the beginning, the size of circle equals to 200. The smallest size that circle could has is 10 and the highest equals to 500.

If we move our mouse outside the window, the circles will freeze.

There is a counter at the top left side that counts the count of circles.

We can also create multiple circles by holding down the screen.

This is a video of how it works.
